This will show normal compactiopn trend line for the well NGHP 01 8A and NGHP 01 19B.
Compaction reduces porosity and alters properties like sonic travel time as sediments are buried.
A normal compaction trend derived from sonic logs reflects the relationship between depth and sonic travel time.
Deviations from this trend indicate overpressure or other geological anomalies.
Normal Compaction Trend identifies zones deviating from expected compaction, often due to factors like gas hydrates or free gas.
It is plotted and used to identify anomalies in sonic log data.
These anomalies help estimate pore pressures in key zones of interest.
