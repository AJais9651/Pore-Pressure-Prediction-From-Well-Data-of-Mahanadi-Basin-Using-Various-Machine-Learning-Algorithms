Correlation matrix
This heatmap shows the correlation between key healthy log parameters and pore pressure 
High Correlation:
Eaton_PP and Bower_PP (0.82): A strong correlation suggests that both methods produce consistent pressure estimations.
HP (Hydrostatic Pressure) and Eaton_PP (0.99): This indicates that Eaton's pore pressure model is susceptible to hydrostatic pressure variations.
Sonic and Velocity (-1.00): A perfect negative correlation, as expected, since Velocity increases with compacted formations.
Gamma Ray (GR) shows minimal correlation with pore pressure (-0.10 to 0.20), indicating limited direct influence on pressure estimations.
Significance:
Highlights the most influential parameters for pore pressure prediction, such as hydrostatic pressure, sonic Velocity, and density.
Negative correlations (e.g., between sonic and pressure) are essential for calibrating predictive models.
It helps optimize input variables for advanced machine learning models, reducing redundancy while maximizing predictive power.

Scatter Plot
This scatter plot compares the predicted pore pressure (using RF,XGB,KNN and AD model) against the actual measured pore pressure for well NGHP-01-19B.
for the input 2 sctter plot shows the good prediction.
among the 4 models , RF model for input 2 dhowing the best result.
The high RÂ² value indicates how excellent the predictive accuracy for pore pressure estimation.
A few deviations may highlight intervals with unexpected formation properties or model limitations.
