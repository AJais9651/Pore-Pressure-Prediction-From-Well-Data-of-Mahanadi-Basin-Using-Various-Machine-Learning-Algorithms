## Petrophysical Analysis of GHSZ and BSR Depths

## Key Observations

- **Log Responses in GHSZ Sediments:**  
  - Resistivity, density, and P-wave velocity exhibit higher values within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) compared to below the bottom-simulating reflector (BSR).  
  - These high values are crucial for identifying BSR depths in the wells.

- **Gamma Log Insights:**  
  - The gamma log records a high range of 65â€“160 API, indicating the presence of clay or silt within the GHSZ.  
  - As reported by Shukla et al. (2022) and Singha et al. (2019), the gamma-ray log is useful for inferring lithological variations, distinguishing between mud- and clay-rich shale formations.

- **P-Wave Velocity Trend:**  
  - A peak is observed just below the GHSZ, followed by an abrupt decrease.
  - Increased velocity correlates with higher hydrate content in sediments.
  - Below the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), velocity decreases due to free gas compressibility.

- **Seafloor and BSR Depths:**  
  - **Well NGHP-01-19:**  
    - Seafloor depth: 1433 meters.  
    - BSR depth: 208 meters below seafloor (mbsf).  
  - **Well NGHP-01-08:**  
    - Seafloor depth: 1701 meters.  
    - BSR depth: 257 meters below seafloor (mbsf).  

- **Log Plots:**  
  - **Well NGHP-01-8A:**  
    - Sonic time log, density log, gamma log, caliper log, and neutron porosity logs are plotted in Figure 3.  
  - **Well NGHP-01-19B:**  
    - Similar log plots are presented in Figure 4.  
  - BSR depths are marked with dashed yellow lines in the log graphs for reference.

## Significance

- High log responses within the GHSZ assist in identifying hydrate zones and BSR depths.  
- Gamma-ray logs aid in lithological variation analysis, enhancing the distinction between different shale formations.  
- Comparative analysis of seafloor and BSR depths across wells provides insights into the geological structure and hydrate distribution.
