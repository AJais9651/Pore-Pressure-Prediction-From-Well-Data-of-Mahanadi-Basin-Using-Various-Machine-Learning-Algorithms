Lines Representing Different Parameters:
Blue Line (Pore Pressure - Bower): Pore pressure calculated using Bower's method.
Red Line (Vertical Stress): Represents overburden stress (Ïƒv), including the weight of overlying sediments.
Green Dashed Line (Hydrostatic Pressure): Baseline pressure due to seawater above.
Magenta Line (Pore Pressure - Eaton): Pore pressure calculated using Eaton's method.
Yellow Dashed Line (BSR Depth): Marks the Bottom-Simulating Reflector (BSR) depth (~208 mbsf).

Hydrostatic Pressure (Green Dashed Line):
This is the baseline pressure exerted by seawater. Any deviation above it indicates overpressure.
Pore Pressure (Blue and Magenta Lines):
Pore pressure values derived using Bower's and Eaton's methods generally align but show variations depending on the method and depth.
Deviations from hydrostatic pressure signify potential overpressure zones.
Vertical Stress (Red Line):
Represents the total overburden stress. As expected, pore pressure remains below this line since it only partially supports the overburden.
BSR Depth (Yellow Dashed Line):
Indicates the presence of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) above the BSR and a free gas zone below it.

Significance of the Figure
Overpressure Detection:
The difference between the pore pressure (blue/magenta) and hydrostatic pressure (green dashed line) identifies overpressure zones.
Hydrate Zone Assessment:
The BSR marks a critical boundary where gas hydrates are stable above, and free gas is present below.
Comparison of Methods:
The alignment and divergence of Bower's and Eaton's methods provide insight into the reliability and accuracy
