This figure present the value of $R^2$,indicating significant variability in model performance based on the input combinations.

The labels (e.g., [8, 'eaton', RF, 2]) suggest the choice of input of different algorithm and (8, 19) represent the well and the specific algorithm impact the $R^2$ value.

The combinations yielding the highest $R^2$ values involve specific models like eaton combined with RF (Random Forest).

The $R^2$ values gradually decline as we move from left to right, suggesting some input combinations are less effective in predicting the target variable.

This figure aids in identifying the best-performing combinations of input variables and algorithms, which can improve predictive accuracy.
