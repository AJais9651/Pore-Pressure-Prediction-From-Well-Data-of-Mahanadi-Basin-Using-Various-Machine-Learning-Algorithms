## Model Performance Analysis Based on R² Values

This figure presents the value of R², indicating significant variability in model performance based on the input combinations.

## Key Observations

- **Labels:** The labels (e.g., [8, 'eaton', RF, 2]) suggest the choice of input, different algorithms, and the well numbers (e.g., 8, 19), highlighting how specific algorithms impact the R² value.  
- **Highest R² Values:** The combinations yielding the highest R² values involve specific models like Eaton combined with RF (Random Forest).  
- **Decline in R² Values:** The R² values gradually decline as we move from left to right, suggesting some input combinations are less effective in predicting the target variable.  

## Significance

This figure aids in identifying the best-performing combinations of input variables and algorithms, which can improve predictive accuracy.
