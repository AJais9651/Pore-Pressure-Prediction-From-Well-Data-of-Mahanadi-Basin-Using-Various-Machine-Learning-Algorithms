## Normal Compaction Trend Analysis

This analysis shows the normal compaction trend line for the wells NGHP 01 8A and NGHP 01 19B.

## Background

Compaction reduces porosity and alters properties like sonic travel time as sediments are buried. A normal compaction trend derived from sonic logs reflects the relationship between depth and sonic travel time.

## Key Insights

- **Deviations from Normal Compaction Trend:** These indicate overpressure or other geological anomalies.  
- **Identification of Zones:** The normal compaction trend identifies zones deviating from expected compaction, often due to factors like gas hydrates or free gas.  

## Application

- **Plotting and Analysis:** The trend is plotted and used to identify anomalies in sonic log data.  
- **Pore Pressure Estimation:** These anomalies help estimate pore pressures in key zones of interest.
