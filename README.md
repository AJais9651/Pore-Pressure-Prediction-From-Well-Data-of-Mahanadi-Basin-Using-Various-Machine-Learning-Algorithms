**Importance of Pore Pressure Prediction
‚Ä¢	Pore pressure (PP) represents hydraulic forces in the pore spaces of porous rock formations.
‚Ä¢	Overpressure occurs when PP exceeds recommended levels, posing risks to wellbore stability and drilling safety. Accurate PP forecasting is critical for maintaining drilling safety and ensuring wellbore stability.
**Machine Learning in Pore Pressure Prediction
‚Ä¢	Empirical Approaches:
o	Eaton and Bower's methods are employed to estimate vertical stress (ùúéùë£), PP, and hydrostatic pressure (HP).
o	Inputs include petrophysical logs: density, gamma ray, sonic log, and P-wave velocity.

‚Ä¢	Machine Learning Models:
o	Models used: Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT).
o	Input combinations: 
1.	Sonic, density, velocity, and gamma logs.
2.	Sonic, density, velocity, gamma logs + hydrostatic pressure.
3.	Sonic, density, velocity, gamma logs + previous depth pore pressure.
o	ML models are trained separately using Eaton's and Bower's PP estimations as targets.
o	Datasets from wells NGHP-01-8A and NGHP-01-19B in the Mahanadi Basin are analyzed.

Study Area: Mahanadi Basin
‚Ä¢	Gas Hydrates:
o	Icy substances formed when gas is trapped within water's molecular structure under high pressure and low temperature.
o	Found in two forms: filling pores/replacing grains or filling fractures.
o	Significant sand input and organic-rich sediments make the basin favourable for gas hydrates.
‚Ä¢	Velocity Characteristics:
o	Increased velocity correlates with higher hydrate content in sediments.
o	Below the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), velocity decreases due to free gas compressibility.

Bottom-Simulating Reflector (BSR) Significance: 
o	BSR helps identify gas hydrates through seismic reflections.
o	Indicates polarity difference due to contrasting properties of gas hydrate and free gas layers.
o	Often intersects structural and stratigraphic reflections, aiding geological identification.
o	Absence of BSR does not confirm the absence of gas hydrates.

**Petrophysical Log Observations
‚Ä¢	Within GHSZ: 
o	Higher P-wave velocity, resistivity, and density.
o	Gamma log values (65‚Äì160 API) suggest clay or silt presence.
‚Ä¢	Below GHSZ: 
o	P-wave velocity peaks just below GHSZ and then drops abruptly.
o	Observations: 
	Pore pressure increases with depth to maintain hydrostatic balance.
	Around the BSR, there‚Äôs a small rise in pore pressure, suggesting the presence of free gas below the gas hydrate zone.

**Effective Stress Rule (Terzaghi and Biot):
‚Ä¢	Effective Stress (œÉe): The stress that directly impacts the rock grains and controls compaction and strength.
‚Ä¢	Overburden Stress (œÉv): The total stress exerted by the weight of overlying sediments, including the rock and water above the measurement point.
‚Ä¢	Pore Pressure (PP): The pressure of fluids (like water or gas) within the pores of the sediment or rock.

Equation:     PP=(œÉv‚àíœÉe)/Œ±
Œ±: Biot's effective stress coefficient, which accounts for how pore pressure supports the overburden load.
Eaton‚Äôs Method for Pore Pressure Prediction:
Vertical Stress (œÉv):
o	Vertical stress depends on the weight of sediments and water above the measurement point.
o	It's calculated using:
                             Where: 
ÔÇß	g = acceleration due to gravity (9.852 m/s¬≤),
ÔÇß	œÅ(z) = density of sediments with depth,
ÔÇß	h = seabed depth,
ÔÇß	z = depth below the ocean floor.
Normal Compaction Trend:
As sediments get buried, they compact under increasing overburden stress, which reduces porosity and changes properties like sonic travel time.

Eaton‚Äôs Sonic Method:Uses sonic compressional travel time to estimate pore pressure:
 
Ph = hydrostatic pressure (pressure from seawater above),
DTn = sonic travel time in a low-permeability, normally compacted zone,
DT = observed sonic travel time in the target zone.

Bower's Method:
This is an advanced approach to predicting pore pressure based on effective stress and wave velocities.
Key Concepts:
1.	Effective Stress Equation:
o	Effective stress is calculated as: œÉe=Sv‚àíPP
Where: 
ÔÇß	Sv: Overburden stress,
ÔÇß	PP: Pore pressure.

2.	Bower's Velocity-Effective Stress Model:
o	This method relates effective stress to seismic wave velocity.
o	The relationship is expressed as: 
Where: 
ÔÇß	V: Observed velocity,
ÔÇß	Vo: Velocity at the seafloor,
ÔÇß	a and b: Fitting parameters (calculated from data).
3.	Logarithmic Form:
o	By taking the logarithm of the equation: 
o	The equation becomes linear (Y= bX + C) and can be plotted as: 
This allows for a linear fit to find a and b, as shown in Figures.

4.	Results:
o	Figures 1 to 16 show the estimated pore pressures for Wells NGHP-01-08A and NGHP-01-19B using both Bower‚Äôs and Eaton‚Äôs methods.
